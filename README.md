# Hospital Length of Stay Prediction Notebook

## Overview

This notebook aims to predict the Length of Stay (LOS) of patients in a hospital using a neural network model. In healthcare, LOS prediction is crucial for resource allocation, bed management, and patient care planning. The dataset used is the Open Access MIMIC Clinical Dataset 

## LOS Prediction Problem

The primary goal of this notebook is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the Length of Stay (LOS) for future patients. This is a regression problem where the model will learn to predict a numerical value (LOS in days) based on the input features from the dataset. Accurate LOS predictions can help hospitals optimize resource allocation, improve patient flow, and enhance overall healthcare management.
